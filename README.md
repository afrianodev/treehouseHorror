<h1>A React app, for horror genre enthusiasts </h1>
<p>A purely recreational app that I made to watch horror short films with my girlfriend, our favorite genre. I add new shorts every week and introduce new features. Any collaboration and help are welcome.</p>
<p>If anyone is interested in collaborating on improvements, you are completely welcome. You can send me a message here. I am practicing and trying to improve my skills with React.</p>
